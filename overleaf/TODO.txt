1. run all simulations without applying losses
2. run all simulations with 2 WGD
3. find a case where greedy can find the true mapping much better than lca and visualize it



- find biological examples in papers
---- try dataset from 2018 paper
---- *look at zotero


- histogram/way to represent data succinctly

- start writing paper
---- results section
---- literature review

- report sum-of-differences in amplitude?

- calculate TP-FP-FN
- think about what TP actually is?  Thresholds of 10 GI + 80%, but could it be something else?


- discuss gb0.3 sim 13 bad case: happens because WGD species x has one gene tree with 2 consecutive dups.  That second dup is mapped too low by lca --> creates a segmental dup at that wrong species


- add noise on gene trees.
---- cannot calculate path distance
---- do random NNIs
---- check TP-FP-FN



- test whether max remap distance parameter is useful?



- thresholds for segmental dups
---- 0-10: nothing
---- 10-60: Segmental type1 
---- WGD: 60+
or 
---- 10-80: Segmental type2
---- WGD: 80+



- other measure: pairs of dup gene tree nodes in the same species




- determine what matters for output (prediction of segmental dups?)

- visualize trees on which lca is bad 






** WRITING ** 

- See my note on up moves vs down moves in ``Why down-moves are not allowed to remap descendants''.
I do not want to get to the formal stuff in Down moves until it is justified.

- To my knowledge, our stochastic procedure is called simulated annealing (SA).  I am not an expert in that, so please backcheck.
Also to my understanding, the temperature evolves during the prcedure.

- Is it necessary to describe the exploration strategy in detail?  It is quite standard.

- The proofs are long and boring.  My plan is to send them to an Appendix and replace them with a sketch + figures.
